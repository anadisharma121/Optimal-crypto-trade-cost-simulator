# Optimal Crypto Trade Cost Simulator

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project simulates the execution cost of large cryptocurrency market orders by integrating financial models with machine learning predictions. It combines:

* The **Almgren-Chriss optimal execution model** for market impact.
* Regression-based techniques to estimate **slippage** and **maker/taker ratios**.
* A web interface (Streamlit) for user interaction.

The goal is to provide traders, quants, and researchers with insights into how trade size, volatility, and market fees impact cost.

## âœ¨ Features

* âœ… Real-time simulation of crypto trade execution
* ðŸ“‰ Estimates slippage, market impact, fees, and net cost
* ðŸ“Š Visualizes execution paths over time
* ðŸ•’ Measures and displays latency metrics
* ðŸ§  Uses regression models for slippage prediction and maker/taker classification
* ðŸ“¡ Fully functional via a web-based frontend

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Run Backend (Google Colab)

* Open `backend.ipynb` in Google Colab
* Run all cells (sets up FastAPI + exposes via ngrok)
* Copy the ngrok public URL (e.g., `https://xyz.ngrok-free.app`)

### 2. Run Frontend (Locally)

```bash
pip install streamlit requests
streamlit run frontend.py
```

* Use the ngrok URL as the backend URL
* Enter simulation parameters and click **"Run Simulation"**
